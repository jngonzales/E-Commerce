# 🔧 BikeHub - Recent Fixes & Improvements

## Latest Updates (Current Session)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 1. Fixed Category Filtering Issue
**Problem:** Footer category links and shop dropdown were not working. Users could only filter once, subsequent clicks didn't update the product list.

**Root Cause:** 
- Frontend was using category IDs in some places and slugs in others
- Backend expected slugs but ProductsPage was querying by ID
- URL params weren't being read on page load

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated ProductsPage to consistently use category slugs
- ✅ Modified backend controller to accept slugs and convert to ObjectIds
- ✅ Added useEffect to read URL parameters on mount
- ✅ Fixed Clear All and Clear Filters buttons
- ✅ Updated active filter badges to show correct category names

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` - Complete refactor for slug-based filtering
- `backend/src/controllers/productController.ts` - Added Category lookup by slug

#### 2. Fixed Sort Dropdown Not Working
**Problem:** Sort dropdown (Newest, Price Low/High, Name A-Z) wasn't correctly filtering products.

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend was sending values like "newest", "price-low", "price-high"
- Backend was expecting "-createdAt", "price", "-price"
- Mismatch between frontend sort values and backend expectations

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated frontend to send correct sort values ("-createdAt", "price", "-price", "name")
- ✅ Modified backend to properly handle all sort variations
- ✅ Fixed default sort value from "newest" to "-createdAt"

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` - Updated sort dropdown values
- `backend/src/controllers/productController.ts` - Enhanced sort handling

#### 3. Fixed 500 Errors on Category Filtering
**Problem:** Category pages returning 500 Internal Server Error.

**Root Cause:**
- Rate limiter was too strict and blocking legitimate browsing
- Product controller was trying to cast category slugs to ObjectIds directly

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added skip logic to rate limiter for products/categories browsing
- ✅ Increased rate limit to 100 requests per minute (from 15 minutes)
- ✅ Fixed category lookup to use slugs properly
- ✅ Increased auth rate limit to 10 attempts (from 5)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/server.ts` - Updated rate limiter configuration
- `backend/src/controllers/productController.ts` - Fixed category querying
